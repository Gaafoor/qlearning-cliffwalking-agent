# qlearning-cliffwalking-agent
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using **Tabular Q-Learning** to solve the classic `CliffWalking-v0` environment from OpenAI Gym.

The goal is to train the agent to navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding the cliff area, which triggers strong negative penalties.
